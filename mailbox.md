    <h1>Let's get mailbox app alive again. Like it should be.</h1>
  <p>​If you got here, then you're probably disappointed (exactly like we are) that Dropbox® is discontinuing the best email application that ever existed - Mailbox®. (if you're not, but want to quickly cleanup your inbox to Zero, check <a href="/about">what it's all about</a>)
</p><p>
So many times Mailbox has helped us to quickly get rid of all unimportant stuff from our Inboxes, focus on things that mattered and postpone what couldn't be handled right now. We think, that none of current mobile email apps follows it's spirit. None of them is so focused on wiping out Inbox in just few seconds.</p>

<div style="margin-top: 60px;">
<h1>Who we are.</h1>
<p>
We're 2 experienced developers on our journey to recreate Mailbox, without all this unneeded fluff offered by other email apps out there. First for iOS, then anything else - Android, Web, Mac...​
</p>
<p>
​​This is not an easy task and cannot be done without any financial support. We expect this app to be paid (somewhere around 3.99$). If you're still interested please leave us your email, so we know you care and let you know when it's ready.
